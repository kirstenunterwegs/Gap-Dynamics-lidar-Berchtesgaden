# Gap-Dynamics-lidar-Berchtesgaden
Analysis of gap dynamics with high-resolution repeat lidar data in the Berchtesgaden Nationalpark 

This project aims to use repeat lidar data of the Berchtesgaden Nationalpark in southern Germany to detetct forest gaps and gap change dynamics within closed forest areas (according to FAO definition). 

Data are provided by the Berchtesgaden Nationalpark and this work is done in the framework of my master thesis under the supervision of the Earth Observation Lab (Humboldt Universität zu Berlin) and the chaid of Ecosystem Dynamics and Forest Management in Mountain Landscapes (Technische Universität München).
